This assignment includes ten ARMv7 programs on loops, memory, and strings. It covers array operations, memory copying, finding max/min, and basic string handling using instructions like LDR, STR, CMP, and BNE. The tasks build understanding of control flow, data movement, and low-level programming in ARM.
